                    the Services to you. There may be circumstances where Doctormeetup will not correct, delete or
                    update your
                    Personal Data, including (a) where the Personal Data is opinion data that is kept solely for
                    evaluative
                    purpose; and (b) the Personal Data is in documents related to a prosecution if all proceedings
                    relating
                    to the prosecution have not been completed.</li>
                <li>If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you
                    Services, contact us through support@doctormeetup.com . We will retain your information for as long
                    as
                    your
                    account with the Services is active and as needed to provide you the Services. We shall not retain
                    such

                    used
                    or is otherwise required under any other law for the time being in force. After a period of time,
                    your
                    data may be anonymized and aggregated, and then may be held by us as long as necessary for us to
                    provide

                    Please note that your withdrawal of consent, or cancellation of account may result in Doctormeetup
                    being
                    unable to provide you with its Services or to terminate any existing relationship Doctormeetup may
                    have
                    with
                    you.</li>
                <li>If you wish to opt-out of receiving non-essential communications such as promotional and
                    marketing-related information regarding the Services, please send us an email at

                    .
                </li>
                <li>Doctormeetup may require the User to pay with a credit card, wire transfer, debit card or cheque for
                    Services
                    for which subscription amount(s) is/are payable. Doctormeetup will collect such User’s credit card
                    number
                    and/or other financial institution information such as bank account numbers and will use that
                    information for the billing and payment processes, including but not limited to the use and
                    disclosure
                    of such credit card number and information to third parties as necessary to complete such billing
                    operation. Verification of credit information, however, is accomplished solely by the User through
                    the
                    authentication process. User’s credit-card/debit card details are transacted upon secure sites of
                    approved payment gateways which are digitally under encryption, thereby providing the highest
                    possible
                    degree of care as per current technology. However, Doctormeetup provides you an option not to save
                    your
                    payment details. User is advised, however, that internet technology is not full proof safe and User
                    should exercise discretion on using the same.</li>
                <li>Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when a User or the End-User or anyone who
                    visits
                    the Website, Doctormeetup automatically receives the URL of the site from which anyone visits.
                    Doctormeetup also
                    receives the Internet Protocol (IP) address of each User’s computer (or the proxy server a User used
                    to
                    access the World Wide Web), User’s computer operating system and type of web browser the User is
                    using,
                    email patterns, as well as the name of User’s ISP. This information is used to analyze overall
                    trends to
                    help Doctormeetup improve its Service. The linkage between User’s IP address and User’s personally
                    identifiable information is not shared with or disclosed to third parties. Notwithstanding the
                    above,
                    Doctormeetup may share and/or disclose some of the aggregate findings (not the specific data) in
                    anonymized
                    form (i.e., non-personally identifiable) with advertisers, sponsors, investors, strategic partners,
                    and
