            their
            profile and information regarding their Practice on its Website. These listings of Practitioners do not

            relevance of
            the
            Practitioners on search results, which may take place from time to time. The listing of Practitioners will
            be
            based on
            automated computation of the various factors including inputs made by the Users including their comments and
            feedback.
            Such factors may change from time to time, in order to improve the listing algorithm. Doctormeetup in no
